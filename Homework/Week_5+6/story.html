      <h2> Story behind the visualizations </h2>
      <h4>
        <h3> World Map </h3>
        The visualization of the map and the two bar charts below it, are a result of
        a dataset from the Better Life Index. This index has data from about 40 countries
        accross the world with variables, related to the happiness of people in a country.
        The first visualization shows a world map in which the countries participating in this dataset
        have been given a color. The other countries have been given a grayish color and have no
        function for the purpose of this visualization. For the countries that have been filled with a color,
        the lighter the color, the higher the average satisfaction rate of the people in that country.
        When the viewer hovers over a colored country, you can see the country name and its
        satisfaction rate.
        <br>
        One can see that particularly countries as Australia, New Zealand Canada, Western European and most
        Nordic countries have a high Satifcation Rate. Lower scoring countries are for example, South Africa and Portugal.
        I used the dataset of both 2016 and 2017. There were some minor differences, but it is hard to draw conclusion from
        them without further researching the data. One country that had a 0.4 change up is Mexico.
        <br>
        Another feature of this map is that when one clicks on a colored country,
        it changes the data in the right oriented barchart below the worldmap to that specific
        country. In the next paragraph I will explain what the variables in those bar charts stand for.

        Satisfaction Rate

        <h4> "The indicator considers people's evaluation of their life as a whole.
          It is a weighted-sum of different response categories based on people's rates of
          their current life relative to the best and worst possible lives for them on
          a scale from 0 to 10, using the Cantril Ladder (known also as the
          "Self-Anchoring Striving Scale"). </h4>

        <h3> Bar Chart </h3>
        I have chosen to depict to barcharts for the purpose of comparison. The default
        country I picked is the Netherlands (hence the color orange) and this chart is depicted
        on the left side. On the right side, whichever country is clicked on the map
        will be shown. There are five variables considere, all being displayed as a percentage
        which made it most logical to combine them all in one graph. In the desciptions of the variables
        on this page, you can find the exact definitions, as given by the dataset on the OECD website.
        The colors in these charts are more for styling, but they have been calculed as the higher, the percentage,
        the lighter the color of the bar, relative to the other variables of that country in that specific year.

        It is based on the question: "In the city or area where you live, are
        you satisfied or dissatisfied with the quality of water?" and it

        features of voting systems vary a lot across countries and across types
        of elections, the indicator refers to the elections (parliamentary or presidential)
        that have attracted the largest number of voters in each country." </h4>
